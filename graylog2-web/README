# Graylog2-web

Graylog2 is an open source syslog implementation that stores your logs in elasticsearch.
It comes split into two packages. Server & Web.

The server is written in Java and accepts syslog and GELF messages via TCP, UDP or AMQP
and stores them in elasticsearch.

Graylog2-web is a Ruby on Rails web interface that allows you to view the log messages.
You can set filters, streams and basic nagios alerts.

Both are in very active development.

# Notice
When building this package on Ubuntu systems make sure to use the system ruby (1.8.7) as this recipe uses bundler to package the required gems, using other version with rvm will break the package on a vanila Ubuntu (which uses 1.8.7 as well).
