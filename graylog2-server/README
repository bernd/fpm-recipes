# Graylog2-server

Graylog2 is an open source syslog implementation that stores your logs in elasticsearch.
It comes split into two packages. Server & Web.

The server is written in Java and accepts syslog and GELF messages via TCP, UDP or AMQP
and stores them in elasticsearch. 

Graylog2-web is a Ruby on Rails web interface that allows you to view the log messages.
You can set filters, streams and basic nagios alerts.

Both are in very active development.
